            CAREERDRIVER+ builds a new model for sustainable employment
          </h2>
          <p class="text-xl font-light">
            The CareerDriver+ development project has developed a new operating
            model to promote employment and is seeking businesses to cooperate
            with. The partners we seek are ready to contribute to the
            development of labour available to make it best suit their own
            needs. <br />
            <br />The CareerDriver service involves using businesses’ labour
            needs as the basis for developing job seekers’ know-how and other
            competences, both at the general level and business-specifically.
            The business’s cooperation with the service will consist of meetings
            and presentation events to chart know-how and labour needs, and
            taking job seekers participating in the service into account in
            recruitment. <br />
            <br /> In the CareerDriver service, job seekers will develop their know-how
            in the field of ICT / software development / media and their career management
            skills and strengthen their operational capabilities. The basics of the
            operating model were established in previous projects that achieved good
            results. The service is intended for unemployed job seekers who have
            an upper secondary or higher education degree and are looking for employment
            in the fields of ICT, software development or media. <br />
            <br />The CareerDriver+ project is carried out by the City of
            Helsinki (Helsinki Vocational College and Adult Institute), Laurea
            University of Applied Sciences and Metropolia University of Applied
            Sciences. The project is partially funded by the EU. <br /><br />

          February 2025. The service will be developed throughout the entire
          project, and a model of the service developed and its effectiveness
